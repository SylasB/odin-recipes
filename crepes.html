    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            A very thin flat cake, similar to a pancake, that is served as a base for a variety of sweet toppings or as a food wrap to be filled with rich and savory ingredients rolled inside the crêpe. A typical recipe for crêpe batter will combine flour with egg yolks or whole eggs, and milk or cream. A crêpe can be made as a sweet or a savory crêpe, depending on the ingredients in the recipe. Sweet crepes have sugar and other flavorings that provide a sweet taste to the crêpe batter. Savory crêpes do not have sweeteners, thus they have a more mild taste that does not overpower the added meats and cheeses rolled or folded into the crêpe when it is served. Crêpes that are to be rolled and filled with ingredients should be cooked on only one side. However, it is generally personal preference if prepared well, since a Crêpe cooked on one side or both sides can still be rolled. Cooking only one side of the Crêpe allows for a more moist and tender surface on one side and a more crisp and golden brown colored surface on the other.

                <p>
                    In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.

            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                <p> 
                    Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
                </p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
